## The c302 modelling framework for *C. elegans*

c302 is a framework for generating network models in NeuroML 2 based on *C. elegans* connectivity data. It is primarily intended as a way to generate neuronal networks at multiple levels of detail for the [OpenWorm project](http://www.openworm.org). To see how c302 relates to other OpenWorm subprojects click on the image below:

![c302 structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openworm/CElegansNeuroML/master/CElegans/pythonScripts/c302/images/c302.png)

It uses information on the synaptic connectivity of the network (from [here](https://github.com/openworm/c302/blob/master/c302/data/CElegansNeuronTables.xls)) and uses [libNeuroML](https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/libNeuroML) to generate a network in valid NeuroML, which can be run in [jNeuroML](https://github.com/NeuroML/jNeuroML) or [pyNeuroML](https://github.com/NeuroML/pyNeuroML).

### To install & test

The full set of dependencies for c302 can be installed with the following (see also the [Travis-CI script](https://github.com/openworm/c302/blob/master/.travis.yml)):

    git clone https://github.com/openworm/c302.git
    cd c302
    pip install .
    owm bundle remote --user add ow 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openworm/owmeta-bundles/master/index.json'

This will install c302 as well as all dependencies, including [pyNeuroML](https://github.com/NeuroML/pyNeuroML) and [owmeta](https://github.com/openworm/owmeta).


#### Quick test

To ensure everything is set up correctly try:

1) Regenerate the NeuroML & LEMS files for one instance of the model:

       python c302/c302_Pharyngeal.py B  # generate pharyngeal network (see fig. above) using parameter set B

2) Run a simulation with pyNeuroML:

       pynml examples/LEMS_c302_B_Pharyngeal.xml      

To test all of the working features of the framework run [test.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openworm/CElegansNeuroML/master/CElegans/pythonScripts/c302/test.sh):

     ./test.sh  # or ./test3.sh if you use Python 3

### Docker image

c302 is included in the **Docker** image which contains the complete OpenWorm simulation stack. Click on the image below for more details.

### Usage Examples

#### 1a) Run standard examples with pyNeuroML

There are a number of [example models](https://github.com/openworm/c302/tree/master/examples) included with the standard distribution. These consist of: A) generated NeuroML 2 network description file ([example](https://github.com/openworm/c302/blob/master/examples/c302_A_IClamp.net.nml)), containing the definitions of the cells to use (e.g. **iafCell** for an integrate and fire cell), any inputs (e.g. **pulseGenerator**) as well as the **populations**, **projections** and **inputLists** contained within the **network** (for a full description of the NeuroML elements see [here](https://www.neuroml.org/NeuroML2CoreTypes/Networks.html)); and B) a LEMS simulation file ([example](https://github.com/openworm/c302/blob/master/examples/LEMS_c302_A_IClamp.xml)) describing how long to simulate, the timestep and what to plot/record.

       # generate 2 neurons & 1 muscle with current inputs using parameter set A
       pynml examples/LEMS_c302_A_IClamp.xml      

       # generate full scale network using parameter set C
       pynml examples/LEMS_c302_C_Full.xml    

       # generate pharyngeal network using parameter set B
       pynml examples/LEMS_c302_B_Pharyngeal.xml

Screenshots of a simulation with pyNeuroML of c302_B_Pharyngeal are shown below (left: membrane potential of 20 cells, right: "activity" of 20 cells - a value from 0-1 showing time smoothed activity of each cell):

![c302_B_Pharyngeal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openworm/c302/master/images/c302_B_Pharyngeal.png)

#### 1b) Run standard examples with Neuron

The models can also be run using the Neuron simulator. This should be installed as outlined [here](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/download).

       cd examples
       pynml LEMS_c302_A_IClamp.xml -neuron   # Generate the Neuron files (Python/hoc/mod)
       nrnivmodl                              # Compile the mod files (used for cell/ion channel definitions)
       nrngui LEMS_c302_A_IClamp_nrn.py       # Run the main Python file for the simulation using Neuron

Note: models with the D parameter set can only be run using Neuron (not pyNeuroML), simnce they consist of multicompartmental Neurons, e.g.

       pynml LEMS_c302_D_Pharyngeal.xml -neuron  
       nrnivmodl                         
       nrngui LEMS_c302_D_Pharyngeal_nrn.py

This produces the following (graph on top is [Ca2+], bottom is membrane potential; 3D view on right can be produced by selecting in the Neuron main menu: Graph -> Shape plot)

![Neuron](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openworm/c302/master/images/Neuron.png)


#### 2) Use command line interface to create new network

The **c302** command line utility can be used to generate customised networks of varying size, with different cells stimulated, of varying duration from the command line:

    c302 MyNetwork parameters_C -cells ["AVBR","VD3"] -cellstostimulate ["AVBR"] -paramoverride {"unphysiological_offset_current":"2.9pA"} -duration 300

This will create a NeuroML 2 file and a LEMS file to execute it, containing 2 cells, stimulating 1 of them, and with a duration of 300 ms. It can be run with:

    pynml LEMS_MyNetwork.xml

To see the structure of the network, use pyNeuroML:

    pynml MyNetwork.net.nml -graph 4c  # Try other options like 1, 2f, 5c for varying levels of detail


![MyNetwork](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openworm/c302/master/images/MyNetwork.png)


More options for using the **c302** command can be found with

    c302 -h


#### 3) Change parameters in a file

To investigate how the behaviour of a model changes when parameters are varied, it is possible to change the parameters in the parameters_X.py files and regenerate.

For example in [parameters_C.py](https://github.com/openworm/c302/blob/master/c302/parameters_C.py) there are lists of parameters like:

```python
self.add_bioparameter("muscle_leak_cond_density", "5e-7 S_per_cm2", "BlindGuess", "0.1")
self.add_bioparameter("neuron_leak_cond_density", "0.005 mS_per_cm2", "BlindGuess", "0.1")
self.add_bioparameter("leak_erev", "-50 mV", "BlindGuess", "0.1")
```

To change the model behaviour alter one of these values, e.g.

```python
self.add_bioparameter("neuron_leak_cond_density", "0.02 mS_per_cm2", "BlindGuess", "0.1")
```

and look at the behaviour afterwards (note the package needs to be reinstalled)

    sudo python setup.py install           # reinstall package after change
    python c302/c302_IClamp.py C           # regenerate c302_C_IClamp
    pynml examples/LEMS_c302_C_IClamp.xml  # run simulation

The plots below show the neuron's membrane potential on application of 6 increasing pulses of current before (left) and after (right) the change, indicating how increasing the leak conductance removes the spiking:

#### 4) Adding a new input type to NeuroML model

The structure of the model generated can be altered by modifying the NeuroML model returned in the c302_XXX.py script.
As an example, say we want to add a sine wave current to the Muscles network (specified by [c302_Muscles.py](https://github.com/openworm/c302/blob/master/c302/c302_Muscles.py)), as opposed to the steady current clamp input. This can be achieved by setting the "unphysiological_offset_current" to zero:

```python
params.set_bioparameter("unphysiological_offset_current", "0pA", "Disabling offset current", "0")
```

and (after calling c302.generate()) adding the new NeuroML element for the current and adding the input to a cell:

```python
# Import from libNeuroML      
from neuroml import SineGenerator, InputList, Input
import neuroml.writers as writers

# Create the sine wave current generator & add to NeuroML document
sw_input = SineGenerator(id='NewSineWaveInput',
                      delay='100ms',
                      phase='0',
                      duration='800ms',
                      amplitude='4.5pA',
                      period='200ms')

nml_doc.sine_generators.append(sw_input)

# Which cell to stimulate
cell = 'AVBL'

# create an InputList and add one Input to that cell
input_list = InputList(id="Input_%s_%s" % (cell, sw_input.id), component=sw_input.id, populations='%s' % cell)
input_list.input.append(Input(id=0, target="../%s/0/GenericNeuronCell"%cell, destination="synapses"))
nml_doc.networks[0].input_lists.append(input_list)

# Write over network file created already...
nml_file = target_directory+'/'+reference+'.net.nml'
writers.NeuroMLWriter.write(nml_doc, nml_file)
```

These changes are made in [c302_MusclesSine.py](https://github.com/openworm/c302/blob/master/c302/c302_MusclesSine.py)) and can be run with:

    python c302/c302_MusclesSine.py C
    pynml examples/LEMS_c302_C_MusclesSine.xml

Membrane potential of neurons (left; stimulated AVBL cell in green) and muscles (right) shown below:

![sine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openworm/c302/master/images/sine.png)

Other types of NeuroML input elements are defined [here](https://www.neuroml.org/NeuroML2CoreTypes/Inputs.html)
and examples are shown [here](https://github.com/NeuroML/NeuroML2/blob/master/examples/NML2_Inputs.nml).


#### 5) View and execute the models on Open Source Brain

The Github repository for c302 is linked to a project on Open Source Brain: http://www.opensourcebrain.org/projects/c302. This allows exploration of the generated NeuroML 2 networks through the Geppetto enabled OSB 3D Explorer.

To see a list of the networks which can be visuaised, click on the **More** button on the top right of the page. As an example, the Pharyngeal network with parameter set D can be selected (c302_D_Pharyngeal.net.nml in the Network list, direct link [here](http://www.opensourcebrain.org/projects/c302/models?explorer=https%253A%252F%252Fraw.githubusercontent.com%252Fopenworm%252Fc302%252Fmaster%252Fexamples%252Fc302_D_Pharyngeal.net.nml)).

The initial view of the network is shown on the left below.

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openworm/c302/master/images/pharDpre.png" width=400/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openworm/c302/master/images/pharDpost.png" width=400/></p>

To get the view on the right:
- change the background to white by clicking the paintbrush icon (bottom icon on left)
- open the connectivity matrix (Connectivity button, top left) showing the connections present between cells in an adjacency matrix
- press Connectivity button again and select Force-directed layout
- Run a simulation of the network
    - Persist project so simulations can be run (star on top middle). You will need to have [signed up for OSB](http://www.opensourcebrain.org/account/register) & logged in!
    - Press Run button; set duration to 0.4 seconds; press Submit
    - When dialog appears asking what to record, select all membrane potentials at somas. Simulation will be set running.
- After circle on Experiments tab has turned green, plot some of the recorded traces:
    - press the Control Panel icon (four horizontal lines, forth icon from botton on left)
    - show the list of state variables: x<sup>2</sup> button on top of this dialog. Ensure target button is selected (first of four buttons on right) to only show recorded variables
    - all recorded variables are shown, e.g. c302_D_Pharyngeal.I1L[0].Seg0_soma_0_0.v: membrane potential of soma in cell I1L. select which to plot with icons on right
- Replay the simulation:
    - use the time varying voltage of cells to color the corresponding 3D objects: Results -> Apply voltage colouring to morphologies
    - open the dialog for the simulation time: Results -> Show simulation time
    - replay the simulation: Results -> Play step by step (10x)

It is also possible to view and analyse other configurations, e.g. [c302_D_Full](http://www.opensourcebrain.org/projects/c302/repository/revisions/master/show/examples?explorer=https%253A%252F%252Fraw.githubusercontent.com%252Fopenworm%252Fc302%252Fmaster%252Fexamples%252Fc302_D_Full.net.nml):
